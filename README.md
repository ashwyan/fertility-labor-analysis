**Authors:** Amanda Edwards, Ash Htet, Layla Jurow, Mattea Kalpakoff, Zitong Xu

## Project Overview
This project utilizes population functions, population pyramids, and statistical graphs to analyze trends in shifting social roles within the United States and their consequent impact on population growth.

The analysis explores how family dynamics have shifted alongside declining fertility and changing caregiving norms, specifically looking at:
- Fathers' involvement in child care and household labor.
- Gender gaps in domestic work.
- Labor force participation rates for men and women over time.

## Data Sources
We incorporated data from the following sources:
- **WBData:** Population datasets.
- **FRED:** Federal Reserve Economic datasets.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Plotly:** For data visualization.
- **Statsmodels:** For statistical analysis.
- **wbdata:** API wrapper for World Bank data.

## My Contributions
- Developed Python scripts for data cleaning and analysis.
- Created interactive population pyramid visualizations using Plotly.
- Conducted statistical analysis using Statsmodels and interpreted results.
